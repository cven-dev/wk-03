# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Week 3 course material for CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development, focusing on data visualization using ggplot2 and project data exploration.

## Week 3 Content

- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots with ggplot2
- **Project Data**: Working with real-world datasets
- **Gapminder Analysis**: Exploring global development data

## File Structure

- `live-03a-data-visualisation.qmd`: Live coding exercises for data visualization
- `hw-03a-data-visualisation.qmd`: Homework on creating visualizations
- `hw-03b-project-data.qmd`: Project data exploration
- `learning-03.qmd`: Learning reflection
- `data/`: Contains gapminder datasets in RDS format and country-level data
- `figs/`: Generated plot outputs
- `img/`: Documentation images

## Key R Packages

- `ggplot2`: For creating data visualizations
- `gapminder`: Global development data
- `dplyr`: Data manipulation and transformation

## Working with Data

- Gapminder data for exploring global trends
- Country-level datasets for comparative analysis
- RDS files for efficient R data storage
- Focus on filtering data (e.g., year 2007) and creating meaningful visualizations

## Visualization Focus

- Creating scatter plots with ggplot2
- Exploring relationships between GDP, life expectancy, and population
- Understanding aesthetic mappings and geometric objects
- Generating publication-ready figures

## Key Learning Objectives

- Master ggplot2 syntax and grammar of graphics
- Create effective data visualizations
- Work with real-world development datasets
- Understand data-driven storytelling
